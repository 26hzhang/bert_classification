0 but my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design .
1 i like the size and shape .
1 there are a lot of things i like about it .
0 nothing but hassle with this company .
1 it 's fast , feels great in your hand and looks great too .
1 the games are decent , but u only get 2 to start off with .
1 great sound ; . good interface ; . replaceable , powerful battery ; . good software ; . wake-up , sleep timers ; . multiple play modes
0 the battery does not last 12 hours .
1 zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
0 2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
1 + screen was good , easy to read
1 the program is fully featured , with much of what you 'd want from a security program --
0 after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
0 seems the " program scan " feature did not find the exe file for outlook ! .
1 with accessories , you can make the ipod into a digital recorder , broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology , and play it through your car speakers using either a cd adaptor or fm stereo broadcaster .
1 well linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry .
1 - bright , visible screen
1 nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
1 this one is full of features ( has bluetooth ) .
0 it is not reliable .
0 then the most disappointing was trying to use viper raised panel bits that just barely fit , and i mean just barely .
0 no in box accessories -- an arm strap , belt strap , case , or anything would be nice , but nope . . . moveable parts -- this makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th ; . with moveable parts , its easy to damage an ipod at a gym , so this is for more casual listeners ; . note the ipod mini doesn 't have moveable parts and is made of titanium .
1 a decent piece of hardware with great speed ( i get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem ) and good signal quality .
1 i love the performance and features of this router .
1 the quality is superb .
0 my case doesnt close . . . maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
1 other than that , i think it is the best router for the money .
1 i also wanted to switch to broad com hardware ( which the linksys uses ) because my wifi menisci card in my dell laptop with lucien silicon in it used 70% of my 1 . 2ghz laptop 's cpu when using the wireless at full speed .
0 this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n 't purchase it .
1 sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
0 they said they would refund all the money , but a month later , they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to " handle " and ship a cd ? . -- and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails .
1 i 've connected the phone with two laptops and a ipa 4155 .
1 i do not need to repeat what 's great about this phone .
1 but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
0 first , the cons . . . a tad bulky . . . not the most aesthetic looking player . . . and does n 't support a folder structure .
1 it can not be the computer or the owner , since i purchased mcgee anti-virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems .
1 it powers up quickly , so you won 't miss that quick shot .
0 if it weren 't so big i would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers . .
1 first of all , the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos , sound clips , photos , texts , etc .
0 - the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n 't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .
1 the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
0 looks and durability : i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface .
1 i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
0 the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
0 cons breaks easily .
1 but for what i do use it is perfect .
0 we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but can not be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .
0 after 10 years , i now downloaded mccaffee 's product after calling their support . . . . they answered quickly , and for free , and were very helpful .
0 b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
1 i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take .
1 i couldn 't believe what i had been missing .
0 buttons size is ok for me , my wife , but not my granny .
1 3 . the remote capture and file viewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
0 another thing i don 't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up .
1 you do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the champ .
1 the power , low noise operation , and speed control makes up for the problems i have experienced .
1 canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
1 after upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine .
0 however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
0 but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture .
0 sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan 't up to the task .
1 there is no odor and it is very easy to use .
1 i 've dropped it at least a dozen times to my recollection and it still works as good as ever .
1 it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .
1 from the internet , woodworking books , local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m12v 3-1/4 hp router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price .
1 n6600 supports midi , wav , arm , mp3 etc .
0 the user support service isn 't too great either .
1 this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .
1 overall i 'm happy with my toy .
1 it 's a very intuitive program .
0 short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .
1 i like it 's shape and it 's keypad and joystick .
1 : ! . ok , score 7 . 0 oh yes , the newest color of this phone is quite cool .
1 we lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems .
1 i recently bought the linksys wrt54g router and have been very happy with the router itself .
1 having done all this , i was quite pleased to see that all corners i needed were decently covered by the signal .
1 for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player .
1 bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .
0 the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
1 the only free help you get is in renewing your subscription ! .
0 - this did not feel like quality construction and i was n 't sure how long it would last .
0 the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
1 but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing -- great battery saver .
0 i did it and it was worse the second time around . . . unbelievable .
0 i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
0 hard drive screws up occasionally
1 overall an excellent phone .
0 i say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working , but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that i could have done if so ! .
0 i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work ! .
1 all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .
0 i was impressed by this very inexpensive player . for the first three hours , and then it died .
1 i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
1 and it holds so much music and audio files .
0 the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n 't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
1 audio is mono and fairly acceptable , quiet also with little distortions .
1 you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .
1 i wo n 't go into the details here , as the online sites ( steve's digicams , previews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .
1 setup in xp was instant and intuitive .
1 i have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than i would have if i had purchased a single cheap reliant sharper .
1 if you on the other hand always use automatic settings ( and not manual ) you should be just fine , as the camera features some of the best automatic settings i have ever seen .
1 this did manage to cut the number of pop ups during start-up from 4 down to 2 .
1 so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
1 as for itunes , i don 't find it to be as good as the windows media player as a computer mp3 player , but it is good enough .
1 i also like the lock feature , so it makes the touch pad inactive .
1 the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
1 thank you apple ! . you make fabulous products .
1 i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
0 you can upgrade but then there 's a certain level of trouble involved .
1 in short , the nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution .
1 and for those that are int rested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ) .
1 the program is called nomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows software does .
1 this is a great camera for you ! .
1 either way , can 't go wrong with this price .
1 i have not yet used all the features , like the calendar , etc , but as a music player this little thing rocks .
0 6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; . it does not charge by usb cable ; . this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .
1 glad to see the ed . revised the previous statements regarding image quality .
1 second , the setup cd actually worked perfectly .
0 1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
1 all in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment .
1 decently sized screen -- one of the larger ones on the market at 2 "
1 i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
1 given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .
1 plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
1 i love this phone .
1 since then , i have not found one major problem with it .
1 the blue backlit lcd looks really neat and is easy to read .
0 made the camera totally inoperable .
0 even on the low sensitive level , a slight touch can skip or pause the track .
0 apple 's ipod battery replacement service costs $100 ! .
1 i got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags .
0 too costly and not efficient if you ask me ! .
1 transfering mp3s are a cinch with the included software .
0 the interface used could be better designed .
0 after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem .
0 you can " disable " some of the individual components , but don 't be fooled -- they 're still there and running .
0 its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily , not great from a cosmetic standpoint .
0 3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .
0 the remote is a little hard to understand .
1 the zen micro fm receiver is ok , not great .
1 this isn 't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play airplane with this , are you .
0 it would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die .
1 they were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything i have encountered .
0 i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
0 it 's too bad , though , that ! .
1 for the price and features it is really good .
1 i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
1 the router works fine for both wired and wireless .
1 i am now staring at an array of stuff including zen micro player , stereo earbud headphones , a rechargeable lithium-ion battery , an ac/dc power adapter , a usb 2 . 0 cable , a belt-clip , a stand , a stylish cloth pouch , an installation cd , a quick-start guide , and creative mediasource software .
0 this phone is not suitable for fast people , maybe only for old people .
1 i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .
1 in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
0 we constantly got " windows virtual memory low " error messages popping up foll wed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes .
0 i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
1 a call to customer support ( got to a live person within a couple of minutes ) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance .
0 their site offers no live help at all .
1 second , the " automatic " sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
0 i gave up and got a diaper decor .
0 even after all the nightmare sound problems , i 'd still half-way like this product if it kept it 's promise ; . the ability to store 1500 songs .
0 so , don 't buy this or upgrade .
1 without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .
1 it was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers .
1 i think it 's great .
1 i 've taken about hundred shot with the canon , in varying lighting situations , all in auto mode , and not one blurry picture ! . ! . ! .
0 again , this doesn 't affect regular mp3 files - just subscription drm-encoded files , like those from napster-to-go or yahoo music unlimited .
1 after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
1 then sorting the files is easy as pie .
1 i find it very stable and comfortable to use , it doesn 't jump around or make me feel like i need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control , and it has very good visibility to see your cut .
1 i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .
1 this router does everything that it is supposed to do , so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it .
1 i got this phone yesterday and didn 't find any problems with it yet .
1 try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
0 i have read the installation instructions for both nis 2004 and navy 2004 prior to installation , but still ended up with the same result . . . junk software .
0 the adjustment knob seemed ok , but when lowering the router , i have to practically pull it down while turning the knob .
1 many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n 't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
0 at first glance , i thought this phone was a little too big for me , maybe a little too complicated .
1 even though i never ventured into the cloth land , i was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life ! .
1 the computer interface is 90% good , only losing points due to the fact that " creative " branding is all over the place within it .
1 silverfish color really adds a special touch .
1 and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained , which the diaper genie never did ! .
1 battery life is good for a phone of this size .
1 if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
1 ) no locked-in proprietary business like apple ; . this baby plays wmas too .
1 the price / performance looked just right .
1 and so far , i have been very , very happy with my zen micro .
1 speed is not a problem .
0 if you 've been listening to cd 's in your car for awhile , dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to .
1 built in microphone is great for recording short voice notes .
1 overall this tool is very well worth the price and i have no regrets about my purchase .
1 i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .
0 i have used norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years , the software has gotten more and more disgraceful .
0 - no proprietary headset jack
0 no line out jack - as i said , there is none .
1 the dvd player is fine .
1 the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
0 but those 2 come up every time .
1 comes with a installation cd which instructs you step by step to setting up the router .
1 with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .
1 transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
1 the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut , and the speed control knob is easy to get to .
0 i thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time .
0 is not as intuitive as i would like .
1 i like the speak phone function a lot .
0 second might be a problem i might have with my pc but not too sure , when the player is connected on the usb and i start playing on it and also using the windows explorer , it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronize with the pc during play , which is a bit irritating .
1 reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
1 very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
1 9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
1 it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .
0 linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of disco .
1 it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n 't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player ! .
1 huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
0 ( it had locked up multiple times previously , but always managed to work after wards ) this time , the touch screen wouldn 't respond to me and none of the buttons worked .
1 this player is fantastic in terms of audio quality , ease of use , and features .
1 i didn 't have any major problems installing this software .
1 this is really a no brain er .
1 their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions .
1 ks almost without fail , no matter what your taste in music is : from relaxation music to hard rock , to hip hop , to korean and japanese , to afro-cuban and salsa , jazz , blues , country and pop , this feature performs well .
1 while the perfect odor free diaper pail has yet to be invented , the diaper champ is a good as it gets .
1 i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
0 was a bit wary because the software is windows only and i have an mac .
0 the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n 't come in the overused blue .
0 the flash is very weak .
0 wo n 't play a lot of discs .
1 size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .
1 and the tech writers have made the installation process so easy for people lick my aunt to follow .
1 first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good . . .
0 it is hot enough to be annoying .
1 this thing does everything but washes your dishes .
0 also , for those that complain that the diaper champ isn 't as effective as time passes , keep the following in mind : as babies get older , their diets changes ( aka solid foods ! . ) and so does the smell of their diapers ! .
0 2 ) not very ergonomically - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
1 i am getting better speeds on all my web programs .
0 all the camera 's functionality is only available ( or selectable ) when the screen is functional .
0 you must keep double checking depths .
1 photo stitch ( merge pictures to create a panoramic one . . even my old one can do this and it 's really cool to have it now still )
1 this linksys router does it for the right price .
1 this is my second digital camera , but i 'm much more impressed with the canon s100 digital elph than i ever was with my kodak dc240 .
1 the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
0 i find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can 't tightly bundle it without a mess , the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is outside of the diaper pail .
1 there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
1 this is truly a clydesdale among the industry 3hp+ router workhorses .
0 the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
1 i also like the fact that you can edit your mp3 titles , etc .
0 the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged .
1 so far ( 3 weeks ) , we 've had no problems with the diaper champ at all .
1 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
0 i saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and i feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time .
0 the touch pad is over-sensitive , and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive .
0 when talking the voice is not very clear .
0 i 'm an advocate of nokia , but this phone and the following models ( 7610 ) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
0 iriver has a better fm receiver built in , but the drawback to iriver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed .
1 newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
0 i will never buy their product again at this rate , and neither should you .
1 also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and br mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .
1 2 . it can be operated with one hand - leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table .
0 this is somewhat annoying , but from working with computers ( especially windows -- ugh . . . )
1 it was no problem for me to use their software .
1 best phone i 've ever owned , period .
1 the interface is simple to use .
0 only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash .
0 what this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for different operating systems ! .
0 the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
0 the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
1 i like the automatic key lock function .
0 the other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of norton systemworks before you installs this .
0 the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; . not sensitive enough at others .
0 forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds .
1 it 's easy to use ( just a flip of the lid , and the diaper is gone ! . ) .
1 i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
1 the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
0 unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds . even though they were not damaged in any way .
0 * eax equalizer accentuates diminished quality of mp3 files .
0 secondly , in addition to the lag each time you give a command , it 's just not that easily use able on the go .
0 video output stopped working .
0 in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
0 this is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment .
1 after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace , i decided on the s100 .
1 for more than a year , and it is totally reliable .
1 pi ii 1ghz 512mb rd ram windows xp pro 80gb hd i was able to uninstall nis 2003 and install nis 2004 with no trouble .
1 but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; . an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
1 i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic ! .
1 i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .
1 looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .
0 regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .
0 well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .
1 the arm band is fantastic and it doesn 't budge even at the gym .
1 otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; . shutter delay is n 't so bad either .
1 the box is upstairs , and in the farthest room i get connected at 11-18m speed - that is similar to the older 10m ethernet standard .
1 this camera is great if you 're used to a high-end slr .
1 great product , easy to use , economical , effective , absolutly fabulous .
1 the phone offers a 32 mb mmc card and i think that is certainly the most exciting feature .
1 the height is a more convenient reach than others , where you have to hunch over .
1 it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
0 but now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using freshener .
1 the panorama setting is unbelievable ! .
1 the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
0 the eax sound enhancement feature did n 't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
0 there will be much erasing of text as , one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters .
1 i can use it as a modem for my computer , connect with clients and friends , the possibilities are endless .
0 so , you might inquire , why don 't they make it a first priority to carefully , simply explain how download music from your music library to their device ? . ? . ? . this seems academic to me .
1 everything that i have listed above , the zen has , and more .
0 i can only hear the sound but no picture ! .
1 i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason .
1 the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; . see below ) .
0 solid food poop is very stinky and this diaper pail doesn 't really contain the smell .
0 but the major problem i had was with the software .
1 + / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweaking with settings to try to make it great .
1 the fm tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake .
1 that 's it for now , what are you doing still reading this , click the " add to cart " button already ! .
1 i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n 't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .
1 1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .
0 the zen does n 't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; . even with third party software that " creates " folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
1 i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3 . 5 ) , but unfortunately , i am returning it .
0 i took it out one day and the lcd was not working .
1 a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
0 i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n 't a big problem .
1 the hitachi m12v is a dream to work with , smooth starts , adjustable speeds , micro-adjustable depth , and plenty of power to spare .
0 i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n 't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .
1 at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast ! .
1 overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
1 i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
0 also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4 . 99 / mo . ) never works .
1 likewise , i 've heard norton 2004 professional version is fine too .
1 the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
1 so far i have no complaints with this player .
1 compatibility with other devices is excellent too ; . i 've only found one 11b device that won 't work with its mixed mode ( and it won 't work with *anyone 's* mixed mode ) .
1 handsfree future is good , but not too exciting .
1 this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
0 this time , it started the installation process , then i left for work . i think it will work . i hope it will work .
1 i still can 't believe how fast it starts up .
1 this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
1 i was looking for a compact , rugged ( i carry it hiking , skiing , boating , etc ) camera which is easy to use .
1 yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
1 nice things about the m12v : - in a table , the powerful 3 1/4 hp motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - amazon 's price
0 the touch sarene navigation will take a little getting used to , but once you do , and while the zen is still alive , it 's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies .
1 output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .
1 if i had to do it over again , even with the cost savings of using any type of bag , i would go w/ the diaper genie .
1 the pictures are tack sharp , colors are vivid , and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire .
1 overall the phones fantastic , and i would have given it 5 stars , but its not perfect .
1 it doesn 't bog down under load .
0 my other nit is that it didn 't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything .
1 the camera was a marvel .
1 from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic meg atones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
1 after comparing the included creative earbuds directly against my sony md-e828lp 's and sennheiser mx-400 's , i find myself still using the creative 's , which in my opinion , sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord .
1 if your looking for a great sounding mini player , you can 't go wrong with the zen micro .
1 range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
1 our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
1 this wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer ( with photo quality paper ) .
1 with the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn , it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones .
1 the good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges , i had a new zen .
1 i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
1 i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
1 first 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor .
1 could be better to be a perfect camera ( and some competitors do some of this better ) : purple fringing , details in high-light area , noise over iso100 , red-eyes , ( few ) processing artefact's , ( few ) loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light , automatic autofocus , whizzing while video-playback , better video compression ( smaller viedo-files ) , more manual controls , longer lasting battery , indicator for battery , better protection of the lcd , less weight .
0 i could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days ! .
1 for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
1 it 's easy to use , and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch .
0 i have noted that as you use the tool , sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention .
0 i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .
0 durability : not good . first problem , if you haven 't seen the news recently , the ipods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months .
1 - light , compact design
1 all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
1 this camera is bulletproof .
0 as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .
0 it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation .
0 i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptable period of time for something to work .
0 mine generally requires a charge every 48 hours or so and i don 't really talk on it that much .
0 transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1 . 1 or 2 . 0 .
1 better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility .
1 navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
1 i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
0 i 've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far , and i 've not to get either product working properly .
1 i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .
1 it looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black .
0 the opening could be a little wider , i suppose , but i haven 't really seen anything else that could be improved .
0 again , every review written about the tech line is true . . . after waiting close to 45 minutes i finally spoke to a rep .
1 but at least you re starting with the most photo realistic images ive ever seen from a camera .
1 this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
1 i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
