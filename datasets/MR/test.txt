0 first , for a movie that tries to be smart , it's kinda dumb . and second , what's with all the shooting ?
0 belongs in the too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video/dvd category , and this is why i have given it a one-star rating .

1 greengrass ( working from don mullan's script ) forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in northern ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation .
1 with its hint of an awkward hitchcockian theme in tact , harmon's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone
1 this film is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success .

0 nothing more than a mediocre trifle .
0 this thing is just garbage .
1 it is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come .
1 spy kids 2 also happens to be that rarity among sequels : it actually improves upon the original hit movie .
0 whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche .
1 alain choquart's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating .

0 this version of h . g . wells' time machine was directed by h . g . wells' great-grandson . they should have found orson welles' great-grandson .
1 there aren't many conclusive answers in the film , but there is an interesting story of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys vs . the big guys .
1 it strikes hardest when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain . fifty years after the fact , the world's political situation seems little different , and [director phillip] noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill .
1 a stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for kissinger as a calculating war criminal .
0  . . . pitiful , slapdash disaster . a doa dud from frame one .
0 perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about .
0 a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken .

0 the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down .
0 love liza is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit .
1 american and european cinema has amassed a vast holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than the grey zone .
0 the fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier .
0 apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it .
1 this new zealand coming-of-age movie isn't really about anything . when it's this rich and luscious , who cares ?
0 the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal .
0 i highly recommend irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him .
0 an awful snooze .

1 a fresh , entertaining comedy that looks at relationships minus traditional gender roles .
0 has its moments -- and almost as many subplots .
1 the next generation of mob movie . part low rent godfather . part three stooges .
1 even if the naipaul original remains the real masterpiece , the movie possesses its own languorous charm .
0 flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up .
0 dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick .
1 it's about as convincing as any other arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic .
1 a genuine mind-bender .
0 the movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory .
1 samuel beckett applied to the iranian voting process .
0 unfortunately , carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg .
1 wiseman is patient and uncompromising , letting his camera observe and record the lives of women torn apart by a legacy of abuse .
1 young hanks and fisk , who vaguely resemble their celebrity parents , bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera to the work .
0 i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers .
0  " not really as bad as you might think ! "
1 jeong-hyang lee's film is deceptively simple , deeply satisfying .
0 the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster .
0 return to never land is much more p . c . than the original version ( no more racist portraits of indians , for instance ) , but the excitement is missing .
1 deflated ending aside , there's much to recommend the film .
1 every once in a while , a movie will come along that turns me into that annoying specimen of humanity that i usually dread encountering the most - the fanboy
1 ana's journey is not a stereotypical one of self-discovery , as she's already comfortable enough in her own skin to be proud of her rubenesque physique . . .
1 more vaudeville show than well-constructed narrative , but on those terms it's inoffensive and actually rather sweet .
1 flawed , but worth seeing for ambrose's performance .
0 the plan to make enough into ‘an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller' has flopped as surely as a soufflé gone wrong .
1 the auteur's ear for the way fears and slights are telegraphed in the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug .
0 the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count .
1 one feels the dimming of a certain ambition , but in its place a sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early italian neorealism .
1 this movie got me grinning . there's a part of us that cannot help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something .
1 contrasting the original ringu with the current americanized adaptation is akin to comparing the evil dead with evil dead ii
0 while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor .
1 what saves this deeply affecting film from being merely a collection of wrenching cases is corcuera's attention to detail .
1 farrell . . . thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to willis's world-weary colonel .
